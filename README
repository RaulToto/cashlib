ZKPDL and Cashlib

ZKPDL (Zero-Knowledge Proof Description Language) is a high-level
language designed for specifying cryptographic operations and in
particular zero-knowledge proofs.  Its corresponding interpreter will,
given a program and a set of inputs, output a proof when acting as the
prover and verify a proof when acting as the verifier.

The Cashlib library provides functionality for endorsed e-cash and
fair exchange protocols.  Classes are provided for withdrawing,
spending, and depositing e-coins, as well as for bartering for files
using an e-coin only as a placeholder.  Resolution protocols are
provided as well.

For a detailed description of this software please see our paper in
USENIX Security 2010:
  http://www.cs.brown.edu/research/brownie/usenix10.pdf

Pseudocode descriptions of the cryptographic protocols used are
available in the "doc/pseudocodes" directory.
  http://github.com/brownie/cashlib/raw/master/doc/pseudocodes.pdf

A short manual describing our language syntax can also be found in the
"doc/manual" directory.
  http://github.com/brownie/cashlib/raw/master/doc/language.pdf

These documents are still under development and should improve in the
future.

Many example programs are available in the "src/ZKP/examples" directory.

We would love to hear about your interest in ZKPDL and Cashlib.  Feel
free to contact us if you have any questions or comments!
