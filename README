ZKPDL (Zero-knowledge proof description language) and Cashlib

A language-based system for zero-knowledge proofs and electronic cash (e-cash).

For a detailed description of this software please see our paper in
USENIX Security 2010:
  http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/users/smeiklejohn/files/usenix10.pdf

Pseudocode descriptions of our protocols are available in the
"doc/pseudocodes" directory.  A short manual describing our language
syntax can also be found in the "doc/manual" directory.  These
documents are still under development and should improve in the
future.

Many example programs are available in the "src/ZKP/examples" directory.

Feel free to contact us if you have any questions or comments!
