ZKPDL (Zero-knowledge proof description language) and Cashlib

A language-based system for zero-knowledge proofs and electronic cash (e-cash).

For a detailed description of this software please see our paper in
USENIX Security 2010:
  http://www.cs.brown.edu/research/brownie/usenix10.pdf

Pseudocode descriptions of our protocols are available in the
"doc/pseudocodes" directory.
  http://github.com/brownie/cashlib/raw/master/doc/pseudocodes.pdf

A short manual describing our language syntax can also be found in the
"doc/manual" directory.
  http://github.com/brownie/cashlib/raw/master/doc/language.pdf

These documents are still under development and should improve in the
future.

Many example programs are available in the "src/ZKP/examples" directory.

We would love to hear about your interest in ZKPDL and Cashlib.  Feel
free to contact us if you have any questions or comments!
