\section{Assumptions}
The suggested security parameters above are set to satisfy the following 
assumptions (by conjecture).

Strong RSA Assumption: For $N = pq$ with $p,q$ prime, it is difficult for any
computationally bounded adversary $\A$ to compute $x$ on input $N$, $e$, and 
$y=x^e\bmod N$
for some $e$ such that $\gcd(e,\phi(N)) = 1$, even if $\A$ is allowed to pick 
$e$ itself (note that this last condition is what makes this assumption the
``strong'' verison of the standard RSA assumption).

Discrete Logarithm Assumption: For a cyclic group $G$ of order $q$ with
generator $g$, it is difficult for any computationally bounded adversary $\A$ 
to compute $x$ on input $g^x$, for $x\in{\Z_q}$.
