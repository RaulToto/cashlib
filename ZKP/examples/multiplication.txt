computation:
given: 
	group: G = <f,g,h,h1,h2>
compute:
	random exponents in G: a, b, r_x, r_a, r_b
	x := a * b
	c_x := g^x * h^r_x
	c_a := g^a * h^r_a
	c_b := g^b * h^r_b

proof:
given:
	group: G = <g,h>
	elements in G: c_x, c_a, c_b
		commitment to x: c_x = g^x * h^r_x
		commitment to a: c_a = g^a * h^r_a
		commitment to b: c_b = g^b * h^r_b

prove knowledge of:
	exponents in G: x, a, b, r_x, r_a, r_b

such that:
	x = a * b
