computation:
given:
	group: G = <g, h>
compute:
	random exponents in G: x, y, r_x, r_y
	c_x := g^x * h^r_x
	c_y := g^y * h^r_y

proof:
given:
	group: G = <g, h>
	elements in G: c_x, c_y
		commitment to x: c_x = g^x * h^r_x
		commitment to y: c_y = g^y * h^r_y

prove knowledge of: 
	exponents in G: x, y, r_x, r_y

such that:
	c_x = g^x * h^r_x
	c_y = g^y * h^r_y
